Authors: Erskine, Nathan, Edward, David, Razah, R.J

Project: We decided as a group to create a video game in unity 

Game Description: Our game is a twin-stick top down shooter. The player has access to a variety of weapons which are used to fight off waves off enemies. Enemies are people infected with a deadly virus leaving them as nothing more than shambling shells of their former selves.
